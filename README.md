# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
A weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

- The motivation behind this project was to create a working forecast app that has a weather api applied and fully functioning. 
- This project was built to allow the user to have access to the weather for the week.
- The problem that this solves is it allows for the user to see the current and future weather. 
- I learned how to install and use a api in my javascript.
